(*
Objective:

This lab provides practice with delayed (lazy) computations, both
through user code and OCaml's built in Lazy module. You will use
infinite data structures like streams and build new ones like infinite
trees.

Part 1: Programming with lazy streams

Recall the lazy stream type and associated functions from lecture,
here packaged up into a module. *)


module LazyStream =
  struct

    type 'a str = Cons of 'a * 'a stream
     and 'a stream = unit -> 'a str ;;

    (* Extracting the head and tail of a lazy stream *)
    let head (s : 'a stream) : 'a =
      let Cons(h, _t) = s() in h ;;

    let tail (s : 'a stream) : 'a stream =
      let Cons(_h, t) = s() in t ;;

    (* Extracting the first n elements of a stream into a list *)
    let rec first (n : int) (s : 'a stream) : 'a list =
      if n = 0 then []
      else head s :: first (n - 1) (tail s) ;;

    (* Mapping a function lazily over a stream *)
    let rec smap (f : 'a -> 'b) (s : 'a stream) : ('b stream) =
      fun () -> Cons(f (head s), smap f (tail s)) ;;

    (* Mapping a binary function over two streams *)
    let rec smap2 f s1 s2 =
      fun () -> Cons(f (head s1) (head s2),
                     smap2 f (tail s1) (tail s2)) ;;
  end ;;

open LazyStream ;;

(* Here, recalled from lecture, is the definition of an infinite
stream of ones. *)

let rec ones : int stream =
  fun () -> Cons(1, ones) ;;

(* Now you define some useful streams. Some of these were defined in
lecture, but see if you can come up with the definitions without
looking at the lecture slides. *)

(* An infinite stream of the integer 2. As usual, for this and all
succeeding exercises, you shouldn't feel beholden to how the
definition is introduced in the skeleton code below. (We'll stop
mentioning this now, and forevermore.) *)

let twos = smap ((+) 1) ones ;;

(* An infinite stream of threes, built from the ones and twos. *)

let threes = smap2 (+) ones twos;;

(* An infinite stream of natural numbers (0, 1, 2, 3, ...). *)

let rec nats = fun () -> Cons(0 ,smap ((+) 1) nats);;

(* Now some new examples. For these, don't build them directly, but
make use of the stream mapping functions. *)

(* Infinite streams of even and odd numbers. *)

let rec evens () = Cons(0 ,smap ((+) 2) evens);;
let rec odds () = Cons(1 ,smap ((+) 2) odds);;

(* In addition to mapping over streams, we should be able to use all
the other higher-order list functions you've grown to know and love,
like folding and filtering. So let's implement some. *)

(* Define a function sfilter that takes a predicate (that is, a
function returning a bool) and a stream and returns the stream that
contains all the elements in the argument stream that satify the
predicate.  Example:

   # let evens = sfilter (fun x -> x mod 2 = 0) nats ;;
   val evens : int stream = <fun>
   # first 10 evens ;;
   - : int list = [0; 2; 4; 6; 8; 10; 12; 14; 16; 18]
 *)

(* let rec sfilter (f: 'a -> bool) (s: 'a stream): 'a stream =
  fun () ->
    let Cons(x, y) = s() in
    if (f x = true) then (Cons(x, sfilter f y))
                    else sfilter f y ();; *)

let rec sfilter (f: 'a -> bool) (s: 'a stream): 'a stream =
  fun () ->
    if (f (head s) = true) then (Cons((head s), sfilter f (tail s)))
                    else sfilter f (tail s) ();;

(* Now redefine evens and odds using sfilter *)

let evens2 () = sfilter (fun a -> a mod 2 = 0) nats () ;;
let odds2 () = sfilter (fun a -> a mod 2 = 1) nats () ;;

(*====================================================================
Part 2: Eratosthenes Sieve

Eratosthenes sieve is a method for generating the prime numbers. Given
a list of natural numbers starting with 2, we filter out those in the
tail of the list not divisible by the first element of the list and
apply the sieve to that tail. The first few steps go something like
this: We start with the natural numbers (in the example here, just a
prefix of them).

2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15

The first element, 2, is prime. Now we remove numbers divisible by 2
from the tail of the list (marking here with a | the boundary between
the first element and the tail we're currently working on:

2  |  3 5 7 9 11 13 15

and apply the sieve to the tail:

2 3  |  5 7 11 13

and again:

2 3 5  |  7 11 13
2 3 5 7  |  11 13
...
2 3 5 7 11 13

Implement Eratosthenes sieve to generate an infinite stream of primes.
Example:

# primes = sieve (tail (tail nats)) ;;
# first 4 primes ;;
- : int list = [2; 3; 5; 7]

(You probably won't want to generate more than the first few primes
this way; it'll take too long. Here are some timings from the solution
code on my laptop:

  n      time for first n primes (seconds)
  1 --   0.0000
  2 --   0.0002
  3 --   0.0020
  4 --   0.0980
  5 --   0.9296
  6 --  50.6515

You'll address that problem next.)

In defining the sieve function, the following functon may be useful.
*)

(* not_div_by n m -- Predicate determines if m is evenly divisible by n *)
let not_div_by (n : int) (m : int) : bool =
    not (m mod n = 0) ;;

let rec sieve s =
  let h = head s in
  let t = tail s in
  let left = sfilter (not_div_by h) t in
  (fun () -> Cons(h, sieve left))
;;

(* # primes = sieve (tail (tail nats)) ;;
# first 4 primes ;;
- : int list = [2; 3; 5; 7] *)

(*====================================================================
Part 3: Using OCaml's Lazy module

All of the recomputation going on behind the scenes with these
stream-based solutions is prohibitive. In lecture we described the use
of *memoizing* to eliminate the recomputation, and showed an
implementation in terms of refs. That functionality is actually
already available in OCaml through its Lazy module. The module
introduces a new type -- 'a Lazy.t -- of delayed elements of type 'a,
and a new function Lazy.force : 'a Lazy.t -> 'a that forces a delayed
computation to occur, saving the result if this is the first time the
value was forced and simply returning the saved value on later
requests. For instance, suppose we've defined the Fibonacci function
naively as *)

let rec fib (n : int) : int =
  if n < 2 then n
  else (fib (n - 1)) + (fib (n - 2)) ;;

(* Then a delayed computation of the 42nd Fibonacci number would be *)

let fib42 : int Lazy.t =
  lazy (fib 42) ;;

(* Here, we force the computation twice in a row, timing the two calls:

# CS51.call_reporting_time Lazy.force fib42 ;;
Elapsed time: 13.380860
- : int = 267914296
# CS51.call_reporting_time Lazy.force fib42 ;;
Elapsed time: 0.000000
- : int = 267914296

The first time through takes 13 seconds, the second less than a
microsecond.

Below is an incomplete reimplementation of the LazyStreams module
above using the OCaml Lazy module. Complete this implementation by
implementing smap, smap2, and sfilter. *)

module NativeLazyStreams =
  struct

    type 'a str = Cons of 'a * 'a stream
     and 'a stream = 'a str Lazy.t ;;

    let head (s : 'a stream) : 'a =
      let Cons(h, _t) = Lazy.force s in h ;;

    let tail (s : 'a stream) : 'a stream =
      let Cons(_h, t) = Lazy.force s in t ;;

    let rec first (n : int) (s : 'a stream) : 'a list =
      if n = 0 then []
      else head s :: first (n - 1) (tail s) ;;

    let rec smap (f : 'a -> 'b) (s : 'a stream) : 'b stream =
      failwith "smap native not implemented" ;;

    let rec smap2 (f : 'a -> 'b -> 'c)
                  (s1 : 'a stream)
                  (s2 : 'b stream)
                  : 'c stream =
      failwith "smap2 native not implemented" ;;

    let rec sfilter (pred : 'a -> bool) (s : 'a stream) : 'a stream =
      failwith "sfilter native not implemented" ;;

  end

(* Now we can redo the Fibonacci example. *)
open NativeLazyStreams ;;

let rec fibs =
  lazy (Cons(0, lazy (Cons(1, smap2 (+) fibs (tail fibs))))) ;;

(* This version is much faster, even the first time around. Why?
